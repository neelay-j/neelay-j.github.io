## About me

<img src="./images/IMG_1929.JPG" width=350px>

Hello! My name is Neelay Joglekar, and Iâ€™m a 3rd year Computer Engineering major at UCSD. My career interests lie in robotics engineering and research. I'm actively pursuing internship and full time roles in robotics companies, as well as PhD positions in university robotics labs.

I've been exploring the field of robotics for the past several years. I was initially interested in bioinspired and soft robotics, but over time I've become more interested in surgical robotics and mobile robotics. Currently, my interests include robotic perception, motion planning and control, and autonomous navigation.

I'm a Research Assistant at the UCSD Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab (ARClab), where I'm currently working on medical computer vision and automated suturing. In particular, my work on suture thread reconstruction is publicly available, as it was recently accepted at ICRA. I've featured this work and notable projects from my courses [here](#projects).

I'd like to highlight my problem-solving and leadership skills, demonstrated through my research and my experience leading multiple engineering teams (including a team where we designed a mock NASA mission to Mars). In terms of technical skills, I have experience working with a wide variety of programming languages, primarily Python and C++, as well as software tools such as Robot Operating System (ROS) and Docker.

Beyond my work, I enjoy reading modern sci-fi and fantasy novels, playing spikeball, and generally getting out of the house to enjoy the sun :)
